In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer\\n\\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin 6\\n\\nAttention Is All You Need Ashish Vaswani∗ Google Brain avaswani@google.comNoam Shazeer∗ Google Brain noam@google.comNiki Parmar∗ Google Research nikip@google.comJakob Uszkoreit∗ Google Research usz@google.com Llion Jones∗ Google Research llion@google.comAidan N.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model'"

It’s like when you read a sentence, and you give more attention to certain words based on what came before. In the Transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism plays a crucial role by helping the model decide how important each word or token is in a sequence. This attention layer is like a guide for the model, helping it understand words better. Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, enabling it to understand relationships between words, capture context, and generate more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.'},\n",

The self-attention mechanism then maps Queries to Keys to understand word relationships. This methodology is then applied to every word in the sentence (input text), adeptly discerning the contextual relationships and nuances of each term. It’s important to note that, unlike our sequential way of reading English sentences from left to right, the LLM uses self-attention to establish relationships between all words in an input text simultaneously.'},\n",

Finally, the last step is to compute the context vector z(2), which is an attention-weighted version of our original query input x(2), including all the other input elements as its context via the attention weights: Following PyTorch conventions, the SelfAttention class above initializes the self-attention parameters in the __init__ method and computes attention weights and context vectors for all inputs via the forward method.'},\n",
